abstract: "This document provides an introduction to R Markdown, argues for its benefits, and presents a sample manuscript template intended for an academic audience. I include basic syntax to R Markdown and a minimal working example of how the analysis itself can be conducted within R with the `knitr` package."

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE,
                      message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,
                      fig.path='figs/',
                      cache.path = '_cache/',
                      fig.process = function(x) {
                      x2 = sub('-\\d+([.][a-z]+)$', '\\1', x)
                      if (file.rename(x, x2)) x2 else x

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
